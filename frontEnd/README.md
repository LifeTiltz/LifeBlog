This is currently just a quickly thrown together site. I will be updating this to be a blog that also pulls blogs from different.

It was first written with a Express and SQL as a backend. Its currently serverless and uses Firebase to store my data. This is my first time using firebase. I like it and see a few applications that would make this my first choice, like a GitHub site that only a handfull of people would look at =)
